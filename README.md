## About ##
ClickBot contains an autoclicker, with click delay randomization, as well as a multiclicker. The multiclicker works by using points 
recorded by the user on the screen and moving to each point and clicking. The path to each point is either linear or follows a random
Bezier curve to simulate a more human-like movement.
